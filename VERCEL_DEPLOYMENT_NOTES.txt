VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.txt

Deployment Issue on Vercel:
The project repeatedly failed to deploy on Vercel due to the `mongodb-memory-server` package, which is a development dependency used for backend testing. Vercel's build environment consistently attempted to install this package and run its `postinstall` script, which failed due to missing system libraries. Attempts to override Vercel's install commands via `vercel.json` were unsuccessful.

Permanent Fix:
To enable successful deployment to Vercel, `mongodb-memory-server` has been permanently removed from the `devDependencies` in `backend/package.json`. This package is not required for the production functionality of your application.

Impact on Local Testing:
Removing `mongodb-memory-server` means your backend automated tests (e.g., Jest tests) will fail if they rely on this package in your local development environment.

Workaround for Local Testing:
If you need to run your backend automated tests locally:
1.  Navigate to your `backend` directory in your terminal.
2.  Install `mongodb-memory-server` as a dev dependency:
    `npm install mongodb-memory-server --save-dev`
3.  Run your tests as usual.

Preparing for Vercel Deployment After Local Testing:
Before pushing your changes and deploying to Vercel, you must ensure `mongodb-memory-server` is removed from `backend/package.json` to avoid deployment failures. The easiest way to do this is to:
1.  Navigate to your `backend` directory.
2.  Uninstall `mongodb-memory-server`:
    `npm uninstall mongodb-memory-server`
3.  Commit these changes (removing the package) before pushing to your Git repository for Vercel deployment.

This ensures your Vercel deployments succeed while allowing you to temporarily enable local backend testing when needed.
